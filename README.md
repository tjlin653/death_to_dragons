Death to Dragons is a choice-based card game that utilizes JavaScript for the game logic.

The game consists of 10 turns. By the 10th turn, the player must have gathered at least 30 gems to win the game.

Each turn, the player will be dealt 2 random cards: an EFFECT CARD on the left, and a GEM CARD on the right. 

The gem card has a chance of offering the player either a positive or a negative gem value. The effect card is a high-risk, high-reward opportunity for the player.

The player must then choose between the effect card and the gem card. Sometimes the player can choose between two good cards, but other times, they must choose between two terrible cards.
